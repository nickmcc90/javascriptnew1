<!--In order to only have one button on at a time, we first check to see if the selected button doesn't
contain 'is-toggled' to prove that it's off. Then, we activate code that checks to see if another button is on before we turn this button on.
In the case that another button is on, that means that it is the only button that has the class 'is-toggled', so we querySelector()
the '.is-toggled' class to get that button. Then, we classList.remove('is-toggled') from it IF there is a button
like that out there.-->
